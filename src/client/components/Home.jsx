        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Joe Philavanh. Embarking on a career change into the
          tech world, I've transitioned from the structured life of a
          Non-Commissioned Officer in the Army to the boundless creativity of
          full-stack development. Living in Henderson, NV, I'm bringing the
          discipline and resilience from my military days to my new passion for
          coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          My tech journey kicked off at Fullstack Academy, where I dived into
          Node.js, React/Redux, and PostgreSQL. While I'm new to the field with
          no professional tech experience yet, I've already tackled projects
          like PuckerUp, showcasing my potential to blend technical skill with
          innovative thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm at the starting line of my tech career, hungry for a company
          willing to take a chance on someone who's as dedicated, hardworking,
          and determined as they come. My military background has taught me the
          value of teamwork, adaptability, and overcoming challengesâ€”qualities
          I'm eager to apply in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking for a fresh perspective and relentless drive in your
          team, let's chat. I'm ready to prove that my transition into tech is
          your next great investment. Let's connect and embark on this exciting
          journey together.
